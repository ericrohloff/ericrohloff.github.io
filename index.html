                Hi, I'm Eric Rohloff — a Computer Engineering student at Tufts
                University, graduating in May 2026 with minors in Computer
                Science and Engineering Management. I'm passionate about solving
                real-world problems at the intersection of embedded systems,
                software engineering, and computer architecture. Over the past
                few years, I've worked on projects ranging from building an ARM
                LEGv8 processor in VHDL to creating web-based data tools using
                BLE, MQTT, and Python. My research at Tufts has focused on
                extending the capabilities of the LEGO SPIKE Prime through
                custom hardware and software integrations with ESP32
                microcontrollers. I've also served as a Residential Assistant,
                worked with organizations like IEEE and JumboCode, and developed
                embedded and full-stack applications to support both learning
                and community initiatives. I enjoy building things from the
                ground up—whether it's a PCB, a Python web server, or a digital
                game on an FPGA. Feel free to explore my projects or reach out
                if you'd like to collaborate!
